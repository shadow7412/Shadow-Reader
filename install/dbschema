 Basic ideas for how the database will work
 
 RSSFEEDS
 id, url, iconurl, last checked, last updated
 
 RSSITEMS
 id, feed id, link, subject, date, content
 
 USERS //use OAuth? Maybe? Possibly Graviatar as well?
 id (maybe username), pwd, registered, last seen
 
 USERFEEDS
 idfeed, iduser, sortsetting, showreadsetting, folder
 
 USERITEMS
 iduser, idfeed, shared, starred, read
 
 USERMETRICS  - when a user marks something as read etc we can also put a thing in here. This could mean pretty graphs - like google's trending etc
 iduser, action, date, rssitemid
 
 SCRAPEMETRICS
 date, feeds, newitems, errors, errordetail
