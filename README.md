Shadow-Reader
=============

Google Reader alternative.

Enraged by their decision to shut it down, I decided to make my own version of much the same thing.
When I get time anyway.

Plan (aka, braindump):
=====

Feed Reader
* This will need to collect feed data and cache them into the database (I guess)
* All people subscribed to the one feed should read from the same data (so rss feeds arent bashed for updates)
* People who log in will all have marked and starred options - which will be in a different table

Sharing is caring
* You will be able to view another person's shared threads (like in old google reader)
* Sharing is Global (for now) to ease security requirements

Threads
* You should be able to categorise RSS feeds into folders - and view those folders as an amalgamation of the feeds
* You may Star or Share items from said threads. (Sharing to other social media may come later)
* Shared threads from People will just come up as another rss feed

Google Takeout
* Allow people to import from this service. This will make the transition from Google to Shadow easy.

Mobile
* Yes. But perhaps a bit later. Lets get the thing working first.
